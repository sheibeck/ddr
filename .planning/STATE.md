## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Wrap the existing `mazeworld.html` prototype with Capacitor rather than porting to a game engine — the prototype is DOM+canvas with a serializable global state object, an ideal shape for a WebView wrap.
- [Roadmap]: Engine extraction (Phase 1) comes before Android packaging (Phase 2), which comes before endless-mode balance and mobile UX (Phases 3-4), so later phases build against a stable, decoupled engine instead of retrofitting one.
- [Roadmap]: A thin, store-compliant native build reaches Phase 2 (early) to de-risk signing/storage/lifecycle compliance well before deep polish or store submission (Phase 6).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Endless-mode difficulty curve needs a dedicated playtesting pass (to floor 30-50+), not a one-shot formula — flagged by research as needing project-specific validation beyond genre precedent.
- [Phase 6]: Google Play target-API level, Data Safety form fields, and IARC questionnaire specifics shift yearly — re-verify against current Play Console Help immediately before executing this phase, not from research alone.
