# Roadmap: Delve, Die, Repeat

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Delve, Die, Repeat — Android build & internal testing** — Phases 1–16 (shipped 2026-09-13, override closeout; see `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.1 Monster Balancing & Abilities** — Phases 17–21 (shipped 2026-09-14, override closeout; see `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.2 Class Pass & Mass Playtest** — Phases 22–27 (shipped 2026-09-15, override closeout; see `.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.3 Feel, Loot & Combat Flow** — Phases 28–33 (shipped 2026-09-16, device UAT batch pending; see `.planning/milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`)
- ✅ **v1.4 Combat & Map Screens** — Phases 34–35 (shipped 2026-09-16; device round closed 2026-09-17, on Play internal testing as 1.4.0 / versionCode 5; see `.planning/milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md`)
- 📋 **v1.0 launch tail** — first-run tutorial (04-10 / UX-06) + Google Play production launch (STR-01..04, STR-06); deliberately deferred until after v1.3 (CMBUI reshapes the UI the tutorial would teach)
- 📋 **Next tuning pass** — TUNE-06 roster decision + TUNE-07 human DR round; explicitly deferred out of v1.3 by user decision 2026-09-15 (`docs/DIFFICULTY-RETUNE.md`)

## Engine Gate (non-negotiable, every phase — carried from v1.1/v1.2)

Every phase in this milestone touches serialized character/combat state and/or introduces new RNG draws (bigger-bag drops, store stock). The gate, carried from `STATE.md`:

- Engine stays pure/deterministic.
- Parity stays byte-identical for solo/empty-party play against the frozen `test/parity/prototype-master.js.txt`.
- New RNG draws (bigger-bag treasure, store stock rolls) fire only behind new-feature guards — never unconditionally.
- Every new serialized field (item-carried armor durability, the pending end-of-combat loot pile) is carved out in all three `*Comparable()` functions (`test/parity/harness/comparables.js`) and round-trips through save/load — tolerant of pre-v1.3 saves that lack the field.
- `test/parity/prototype-master.js.txt` is NEVER edited.
- Every new event type gets an `EVENT_NARRATION` entry (coverage-guard stays green, family-friendly voice-safety scan stays green).
- Deliberate divergences from the prototype (e.g. an armor soak-vs-wear ruling change) regenerate only their specific fixtures, each with a documented before/after table and rationale — never a blanket fixture regeneration.

**Explicitly out of this milestone** (user decision 2026-09-15): the difficulty retune (TUNE-06/07), the Play versionCode-4 internal upload, the first-run tutorial (UX-06), and Google Play production launch. None of these get a v1.3 phase.
